## Featured Project: Kindle2Notion Extension

Recently, I built an extension to help organize my Kindle notes/highlights directly into Notion.  
It's not finished yet, but it's working!  
Check it out ðŸ‘‰ [Kindle To Notion Extension](https://github.com/tuliosousapro/Kindle-To-Notion-Extension)

## Origin Story

Although I'm not a developer by trade, I've always been the "computer guy."  
My technical journey started with Tibia â€” building OT Servers taught me Lua and HTML. That's where it all began.
